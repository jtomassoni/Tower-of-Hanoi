### MVP Goals

- Visual game board
- display rules and a start game button
- Move Counter

- know the difference between clicks and placements
- evaluate placements such that we prevent a larger disk from being placed on top of a smaller disk and know if there's a win.
- display a winning message

### Stretch Goals

- customization for # of disks
- Click and drag a disk to another stack
- calculate the least # of moves required for each # of disks and display it.
- modal for intro message and win message.
- gfx/emphasis to show when you've grabbed a disk and placed it elsewhere.
- make stacks graphics of the world's tallest buildings
